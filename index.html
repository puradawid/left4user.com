    <h2>How it works?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Random group of testers are chosen and informed about programme</li>
      <li>Report is getting verified. No duplicates</li>
      <li>Bug confirmed - user gets paid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why it is better than normal testing</h2>
    <p>Left4User is a solution that allows you to <strong>reduce cost of
    production testing</strong>. If the quality of your product is what you
    really care about, it is better to get all user's insights noted down
    instead of trying to involve manual testers to find out issues that they are
    not really doing anyway.</p> <p><strong>Processing (triage) of bug reports
    is not done manually</strong> - AI will filter out duplicates during the
    report. This will reduce time of looking for duplicates after each bug
    report.</p>
    <p>You will <strong>always pay for valid outcome</strong> - user will get
    paid only if the issue is not a duplicate and it has valid and
    understandable description. Moreover we will record all steps (anonymised)
    to get issue that would be clear to reproduce it and get all environmental
    data (browser, width/height, network, etc) automatically reported.</p>
    <p>We care about <strong>security</strong>. Data remains encrypted over all
    channels and you can select which data is too vulnerable to be processed by
    out AI engine.</p>
    <p>Don't hesitate with installation of our solution. We care about
    <strong>one-click deployment process</strong>. No more reading 20 pages of
    manual before getting Left4User installed on your page</p>
    <p>You can <strong>point percent of people being involved</strong>. We will randomly pick
    people to represent the entire society of users.</p> 
    <p>Two ways for paying users: automatic or pre-paid model. Spend budget you
    can spend. <strong>Do not worry about draining your funds anymore!</strong></p>
