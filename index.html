    <h2>How it works?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>We pick up user to a randomized sample and inform about programme</li>
      <li>User finds a bug and report it with one click and writes additional description</li>
      <li>Report is getting verified by our AI</li>
      <li>AI and you confirm that report is valid - user gets paid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why it is better than normal testing</h2>

    <p>
    Left4User is a solution that allows you to <strong>reduce cost of
    production testing</strong>. If the quality of your product is what you
    really care about, it is better to get all user's insights noted down
    instead of trying to involve manual testers to find out issues that they
    are not really doing anyway.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>Processing (triage) of bug reports
    is not done manually</strong> - AI will filter out duplicates during the
    report. This will reduce time of looking for duplicates after each bug
    report.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You will <strong>always pay for a valid outcome</strong> - user will get
    paid only if the issue is not a duplicate and it has valid and
    understandable description. Moreover, we will record all steps (anonymised)
    to have a clear way to reproduce bug and collect automatically all
    environmental data (browser, width/height, network, etc).</p> <p>We care
    about <strong>security</strong>. Data remains encrypted over all channels
    and you can select which data is too vulnerable to be processed by out AI
    engine. You will have the power to decrypt that data on your side (RSA).
    </p>

    <p>
    Don't hesitate with installation of our solution. We care about
    <strong>one-click deployment process</strong>. You don't need to read 20
    pages of manual before installing Left4User on your website.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can <strong>point percent of people being involved</strong>. We will
    randomly pick people to represent the entire statistical representation of
    users.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
    Two ways for paying users: automatic or pre-paid model. Spend budget you
    can spend. <strong>Do not worry about draining your funds anymore!</strong>
